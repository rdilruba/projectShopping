# Shopping Project

This repo is the backend for our shopping site project and a collaboration of [@rdilruba](https://https://github.com/rdilruba) and [@furkanaydar](https://https://github.com/furkanaydar).

In this application, we have simply implemented Spring Security (JWT Auth) and Spring MVC architecture.

You can also take a look at project's frontend repo [here](https://github.com/rdilruba/projectShoppingFrontend), created with ReactJS.
